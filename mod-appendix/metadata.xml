Required Mods: Hyperspace (for multi-page ship list)

Pros:
	1. Layout which minimises distance between Systems.
	2. Central Medbay/Clonebay for crew to heal/revive and get back to stations fast.
	3. Excellent venting capabilities, can funnel intruders into the Medbay on A and B.
Cons:
	1. Low starting crew, system levels and/or reactor.
	2. Compact design means more likely for lasers to hit multiple rooms.
	3. Less systemless rooms means more likely for enemy to hit an important room.

Lore: The Federation is strapped on cash, thus ships are compact and poorly-equipped, not even enough for proper textures.

Square A (The Hip): Weapon focus
Square B (Reg Forgone): Drone focus
Square C (Fang Xing): Boarding focus

See Github page for images and other information.

For modders:
Internally they are called PLAYER_SHIP_SQUARE_CM (_2, _3).
Only enough weapon mounts for Weapons Control for each ship, add more if you wish.
