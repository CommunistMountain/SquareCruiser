Requires the Hyperspace mod for the multi-page ship list, as it does not replace any vanilla ship. Hyperspace also has a fix for the "WEAPONS" and "AUTOFIRE" graphics overlapping for ships with 2 or less max weapons, applicable for Square B.

If what you see in-game does not match the advertised description, please submit an issue, or contact me on Reddit (CommunistMountain) or Discord (CommunistMountain#0463).

Pros:
	1. Non-human crew.
	2. Short distance between systems.
	3. All external rooms can be vented, which makes extinguishing fires and suffocating intruders easy.

Cons:
	1. Low starting crew, system levels and/or reactor.
	2. Compact design means it is more likely for enemy beams to hit multiple rooms.
	3. Less systemless rooms means it is more likely for the enemy to damage an important room.

Lore: The Federation is strapped on cash, thus ships are compact and poorly-equipped, not even enough for proper textures.

Square A (The Hip): Weapon focus. "Making the most of a limited budget, this ship is designed to minimise distance between systems and funnel intruders towards the Medbay."
Square B (Reg Forgone): Drone focus. "This ship was designed by a drone fanatic, capable of controlling up to 4 drones at once, and starting with a Drone Recovery Arm."
Square C (Fang Xing): Boarding focus. "This ship goes all-in with the boarding strategy, having more crew, a Crew Teleporter, and the ability to bypass supershields."

See Github page for images and other information.

For modders: Internally they are called PLAYER_SHIP_SQUARE_CM (_2, _3). Only enough weapon mounts for Weapons Control for each ship, add more if you wish.
