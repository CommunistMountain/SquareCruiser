Requires the Hyperspace mod for the multi-page ship list, as it does not replace any vanilla ship. Hyperspace also has a fix for the "WEAPONS" and "AUTOFIRE" graphics overlapping for ships with 2 or less max weapons, applicable for Square B.

If what you see in-game does not match the advertised description, please submit an issue, or contact me on Reddit (CommunistMountain) or Discord (communistmountain, formerly CommunistMountain#0463).

Pros:
	1. Non-human crew.
	2. Short distance between systems.
	3. Medbay/Clone Bay is centralised, allowing crew to walk to/from it quickly.
	4. Doors are positioned such that rooms can be vented towards the Medbay/Clone Bay, making it easy to deal with intruders and fire.

Cons:
	1. Compact design means it is more likely for enemy beams to hit multiple rooms.
	2. Less systemless rooms means it is more likely for the enemy to damage an important room.
	3. If enemy hacking (or other door-locking effect) targets the Medbay/Clone Bay, many parts of the ship would be cut off from each other.

Lore: The Federation is strapped on cash, not even enough for proper textures, thus ships are designed to be minimalistic.

Square A (Nausicaä): Weapon focus. "This ship is designed to burn enemy vessels. Comes with Cloaking to buy time while arming the Fire Beam."
Square B (The Mothership): Drone focus. "This ship was designed by a drone fanatic, able to control up to 4 drones at once and recover non-destroyed drones, at the cost of having fewer weapon slots and no Shields."
Square C (Ragnarr Loðbrók): Boarding focus. "This ship goes all-in with the boarding strategy, capable of bypassing supershields, and trading medical facilities for a healing Teleporter."

See Github page for images and other information.

For modders: Internally they are called PLAYER_SHIP_SQUARE_CM (_2, _3). Only enough weapon mounts for Weapons Control for each ship, add more if you wish.
